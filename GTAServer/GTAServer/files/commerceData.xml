Get yourself down to The San Andreas Flight School. Grab the stick of the fast and nimble Western Besra training jet and push it to the edge of the envelope.

Hit the silk with a collection of new Chutes and Parachute Bags, and if things get a little out of control, rely on the Reserve Parachute to give you a second chance at that soft landing – or use it to get creative with your precision dives. Later, hit the streets in the shapely Invetero Coquette Classic, available in either hard-top or topless roadster variants for whatever your sea-level speed fix.</LongDesc>

Visit Ammu-nation to expand your arsenal with a pair of potent new firearms: the Heavy Shotgun delivers serious stopping power in close quarters, and the Marksman Rifle can drop targets from long range with lethal accuracy. And suit up your team with new Outfits, along with new Masks, Tops, Pants, Bulletproof Helmets and more.

			<Name>The Ill-Gotten Gains Update Part 1</Name>
			<ShortDesc></ShortDesc>
			<LongDesc>Due to a surge in high-end crime across southern San Andreas, demand for luxury goods and services is at an all-time high. Upscale merchants of all kinds are scrambling to fill their inventories to serve the newly wealthy. This is the first of two major deliveries to hit the showrooms of luxury car dealerships, the shelves of top arms suppliers and other prestigious retailers as part of the Ill-Gotten Gains Update.</LongDesc>

			<Name>The Ill-Gotten Gains Update Part 2</Name>
			<ShortDesc></ShortDesc>
			<LongDesc>A love of the finer things is one of the few ways a career criminal can celebrate success – something the high-end retailers of Rockford Hills and beyond know all too well. With an outbreak of Heists hitting the city recently, merchants have rushed to re-stock their shelves and showrooms with exotic collectables to accommodate Los Santos’ new class of heavily armed and upwardly mobile professionals.  

Part 2 of The Ill-Gotten Gains Update delivers desirable new vehicles, unforgiving new weapons and clothes to make you stand out in a crowd. For the unconventional, the Coil Brawler is a luxury sports-styled off-roader with raised suspension and a 400 horsepower engine that will muscle its way over any terrain. If top speed is what matters most, the Progen T20 is among the fastest cars to ever arrive in Los Santos, while the Dinka Vindicator motorcycle adds agility and speed, featuring a kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) that stores energy from braking and delivers a burst of speed on activation.  

For a level of refinement that only dirty money can buy, the Lampadati Toro screams sophistication – a speedboat crafted with the finest timber from protected rainforests, six-inch lacquer finishing and twin v12 engines. Meanwhile, a range of exotic weaponry hits Ammu-Nation with the wood-finished Marksman Pistol, a single-shot weapon with more stopping power than a pump action shotgun, or the slightly more personal, solid gold Knuckle Dusters.

For those who prefer to wear their status as conspicuous consumers, the iFruit Snap Watch adds a hint of tech savvy to your wrist, or opt for a more classically opulent timepiece with the Medici Radial or Covgari Universe – all available at retailers across Los Santos alongside a massive selection of new apparel and jewelry for men and women. 

In other news, the Ill-Gotten Gains Update Part 2 brings the debut of a new radio station, The Lab on all four console versions of GTAV. Hosted by Dr. No and the Chemical Bro., The Lab features all new tracks created by The Alchemist and Oh No and inspired by their work on the original score for GTAV, with featuring guest appearances from Killer Mike, Little Dragon, Earl Sweatshirt, Phantogram, Freddie Gibbs and more.
